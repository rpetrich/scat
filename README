Super Cat!
A cat that jumps tall buildings!
Created by Ryan Petrich because I needed a cat that starts in the middle of a file and that reports its status

Usage:
  scat file offset
  file = path to a file or device on disk
  offset = offset into file as an integer (> 32 bits allowed)
Example:
  scat /dev/rdisk0s2s1 13478297600
